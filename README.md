This repository demonstrates a simple buffer overflow vulnerability in x86 assembly code. The code attempts to increment a value at a memory location specified by a pointer. If this pointer is not properly validated, the code may write to memory it does not have access to, leading to a buffer overflow. The bug solution demonstrates how to resolve the vulnerability by adding bounds checking to the code.
